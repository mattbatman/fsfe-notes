In the course, Jem buys a domain from namecheap.com. He briefly touches on different types of configuration records.

```bash
# Display the records associated with this domain
dig jemyoung.com
```

He sets up 2 A Records associated with his IP address (`@` and `www`). He uses the Digital Ocean user interface and the Name Cheap interface to create the records.
